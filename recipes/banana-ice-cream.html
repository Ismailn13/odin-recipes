    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>For a creamy, naturally sweet, healthy, easy frozen dessert that can satisfy your ice cream cravings, we recommend this two-ingredient ice “cream.” There isn’t any cream in this recipe, or much of anything else besides bananas. But the fruit is full of natural sugars and has a creamy texture that works well when frozen and blended. After you master this basic recipe, you can play around with adding other ingredients to it, such as nut butter, cinnamon, or cocoa powder.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
    
    <ul>

        <li>4 Bananas</li>
        <li>Caramel Sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>Fleur de sel (optional)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3> 
    
    <ol>

        <li>Peel and slice bananas.</li>
        <li>In a freezer-safe bowl, place sliced bananas in freezer for at least 2-3 hours to freeze through.</li>
        <li>Once frozen solid, add the bananas to a food processor and blend on high until smooth.</li>
        <li>You will need to scrape the processor bowl a few times in between.</li>
        <li>Each banana gives you about one scoop. Enjoy with caramel sauce (caramel topped with fleur de sel), if you wish.</li>

    </ul>
